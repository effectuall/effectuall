        Telescopes are meant for viewing distant objects, producing an image that is larger than the image
        that can be seen with the unaided eye. Telescopes gather far more light than the eye, allowing dim
        objects to be observed with greater magnification and better resolution.
      </p>
      <h2>Astronomical Telescope </h2>
      <p> The most common two-lens telescope, like the simple microscope,
        uses two positive lenses (convex lenses):
      <ol>
        <li>Objective lens</li>
        <li>Eyepieces</li>
      </ol>
      The objective lens, forms the image of a distant object at its
      focal length, and the eyepiece, which acts as a simple magnifier
      with which to view the image formed by the objective.
      </p>
      <p>
        For astronomical telescope, the object is so far away from the telescope
        that it is essentially at infinity compared with the focal lengths of the lenses.
        Also,
      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li>&#10148; <strong> The length of an astronomical telescope is equal to \(\boldsymbol{f_{o} + f_{e}}\),
            and</strong> </li>

        <li>&#10148; <strong> Angular magnification, \(\boldsymbol{M = - f_{o}/f_{e}}\). </strong> </li>
        <li>&#10148; <strong>Final image is enlarged and inverted, </strong></li>
      </ul>
      where, \(f_{o}\) is the focal length of the objective and \(f_{e}\) is the focal length
      of the eyepiece.

      </p>

            was formed by the bending of light. </strong>

      <h2> Galilean or Terrestrial Telescope</h2>

      <p>
        The astronomical telescope can be used for terrestrial viewing, but seeing the image upside down
        is a definite inconvenience. Viewing stars upside down is no problem. Another inconvenience for
        terrestrial viewing is the length of the astronomical telescope, equal to the sum of the focal
        lengths of the objective and eyepiece lenses. A shorter telescope with upright viewing is the
        Galilean telescope.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Galilean or terrestrial telescope uses a convex (positive) objective and the concave (negative)
        eyepiece and such an arrangement produces an upright image and is used in spyglasses and opera glasses.
        It gives erect images and is shorter than the astronomical telescope with the same power. It's angular
        magnification \(M = - f_{o}/f_{e}\).
