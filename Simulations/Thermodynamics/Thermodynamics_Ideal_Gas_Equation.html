            very weak.

            &#160; &#xa0; &#10148; For a gas, the volume is entirely determined by the container holding the gas. Thus,
            equations involving gases will contain the volume V as a variable, rather than focusing on a change in the
            volume from an initial value.

            &#160; &#xa0; &#10148; For a gas, it is useful to know how the quantities volume V, pressure P, and
            temperature T are related for a sample of gas of mass m. In general, the equation that interrelates these
            quantities, called the equation of state, is very complicated. However, if the gas is maintained at a very
            low pressure (or low density), the equation of state is quite simple and can be found experimentally. Such a
            low-density gas is commonly referred to as an ideal gas.

            &#160; &#xa0; &#10148; It is convenient to express the amount of gas in a given volume in terms of the
            number of moles, <strong>n</strong>. One mole of any substance is that amount of the substance that contains
            <strong>Avogadro's number (N<sub>A</sub>) = 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup></strong> of constituent particles (atoms
            or
            molecules). The number of moles <strong>n</strong> of a substance is related to its mass <strong>m</strong>
            through the
            expression <strong>n = m/M</strong>, where M is the molar mass of the substance.

            &#160; &#xa0; &#10148; An ideal gas is confined to a leak proof container whose volume can be varied, so the
            mass (or the number of moles) of the gas remains constant.
            For such a system, experiments provide the following information.
            <ul>
              <li>Boyle's law : When the gas is kept at a constant temperature, its pressure is inversely proportional
                to its volume</li>
              <li>Charles law : When the pressure of the gas is kept constant, its volume is directly proportional to
                its temperature</li>
              <li>Ideal gas law : The equation of state for an ideal gas, are summarized from these observations</li>
            </ul>
            $$ PV = nRT = k_{B}NT $$
           
            where, R is a constant and n is the number of moles of gas in the sample.
            or, N is the number of particles contained in the gas and k<sub>B</sub> is the
            Boltzmann constant, one of the fundamental constants of nature, is given by k<sub>B</sub> = 1.380 x
            10<sup>-23</sup> J/K.

            &#160; &#xa0; &#10148; <strong> Ideal gas relation</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>The ideal gas relation states that hotter gases, at given pressure, need more volume.</li>
              <li>The relation thus explains why winds and storms exist, why hot air balloons rise</li>
